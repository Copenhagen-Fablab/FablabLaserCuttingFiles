# Fablab Laser Cutting Files

This Repo is intended to store files relevant to Copenhagen Fablab and which may need to be accessed periodically over the years.

If you make something for the lab, this is a good place to archive your file. 

Please add a short description text file with the same name, describing what the file is for and any information that might be nice to have if a clueless stranger were to remake your item in the fututre.
